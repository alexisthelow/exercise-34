Why "Death to Amerikkka"?
Institutionalized racism, corporate welfare, poverty, human trafficking, sexism, 
prison slavery, police brutality, alienation and oppression of gender and sexual minorities... 
I could write a list as long as my arm detailing all the problems this country has; 
problems that we generally refuse to fix or even consider.

I don't actually believe that America must die, but I do believe that the way we currently are
must be destroyed in order for us to grow as a people.

What will that look like?

A greater number of racial, gender, and sexual minorities in governing bodies.
Dissipation of power among all people.
Using the wealth we create for the good of all, rather than allowing it to be hoarded.
A total reworking of the criminal legal system; prison abolition and an end to policing.
Transformative and restorative justice, rather than punitive justice.
Teaching love and compassion to our children.
Understanding that we are *all* earthlings, and this planet is our birthright.
Separating the concept of heroism and justice from violence.
Total human and animal liberation. Recognition of the personhood of nonhumans.

How will that happen?

I'm not quite sure yet, but we're working on it. Join us?
